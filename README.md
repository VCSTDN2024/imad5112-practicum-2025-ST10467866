## Design considerations: 
A fun and playful background with clear button background colours and a clear font. 

## Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions:

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed after every step of creating the app. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity. I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process.
